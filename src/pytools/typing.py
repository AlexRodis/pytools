# This module contains additional math functions and definitions, mostly
# related to neural network activations / transfer functions.
# The following functions are implemented:
# - ReLu := Rectified Linear Units, parametric or Leaky
# - ELU
# - | SWISS := The swiss activation function, with fixed non learnable
#     parameter. More accuratly "SWISS-1"
# - GELU 
# - SiLU

# Custom typing module
